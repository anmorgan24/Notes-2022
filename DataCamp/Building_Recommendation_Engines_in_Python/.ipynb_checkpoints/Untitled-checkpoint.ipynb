    "# Building Recommender Engines in Python\n",
    "**Instructor:** Robert O'Callaghan, Director of Data Science at Ordergroove, Data Scientist at Meta\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve come to expect personalized experiences online—whether it’s Netflix recommending a show or an online retailer suggesting items you might also like to purchase. But how are these suggestions generated? In this course, you’ll learn everything you need to know to create your own recommendation engine. Through hands-on exercises, you’ll get to grips with the two most common systems, collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. Next, you’ll learn how to measure similarities like the Jaccard distance and cosine similarity, and how to evaluate the quality of recommendations on test data using the root mean square error (RMSE). By the end of this course, you’ll have built your very own movie recommendation engine and be able to apply your Python skills to create these systems for any industry.\n",
